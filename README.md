# Seat Reservation System

A backend API for reserving seats at events.

## Features

- Reserve a seat for an event (`POST /api/bookings/reserve`)

- Validate event existence

- Prevent duplicate reservations by the same user

- Enforce seat limits with protection against overbooking

- Retrieve booking lists (all, by user, by event)


## Technologies

- **Backend**: NestJS (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TypeORM
- **Data Safety**: Database transactions with pessimistic locking
- **Architecture**: Modular, ready to be extracted into microservices

## Installation

```
### 2. Environment Variables:
